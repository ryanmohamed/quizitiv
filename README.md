  - [x] ~~Poor user experience when submitting a wrong answer.~~Not based.~~(Show correct answer after submission)~~
  - [x] ~~App retains theme when user logs out.~~
  - [x] ~~Optimize search bar, harness query power.~~ Firestore doesn't incorporate a way to use a LIKE query as in SQL. The closest solution without altering the database structure is a case-sensitive prefix search which was recently pushed. A possible database redundancy to fix this is to include a subjectTags field, and include a lowered and trimmed version of each string in the subject field of the quiz. Then query against that array of strings.
  - [ ] Failing redirect on quiz creation.
  - [ ] Implement some kind of caching system on the server side, harness the power of Next.js.
